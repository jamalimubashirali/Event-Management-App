## Introduction

The **Campus Event Management Application** is a cross-platform mobile app created to centralize and simplify the management of campus events. Developed with Flutter, this app provides a consistent and user-friendly interface across Android and iOS platforms, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness on various devices and screen sizes.

## Real World Problem Identification

University campuses host numerous events like seminars, workshops, and social gatherings, often without a streamlined way to manage and communicate event details. This leads to low event awareness, ineffective communication for last-minute changes, and a lack of attendance tracking.

**Key Challenges**:
1. **Decentralized Event Information**: Details are scattered across multiple channels, making it difficult for students to stay informed.
2. **Limited Real-Time Updates**: Last-minute changes often go unnoticed.
3. **Lack of Attendance Tracking**: Organizers struggle with tracking participation and gathering feedback.

---

## Proposed Solution

The **Campus Event Management Application** provides:
1. A single platform to view all upcoming campus events.
2. Real-time updates for last-minute changes.
3. RSVP features for event tracking and engagement.

**Features**:
- **Event Listings**: Lists all upcoming events with key details.
- **Event Details**: Provides in-depth event descriptions and RSVP options.
- **Organizer Dashboard**: Allows organizers to manage events and track attendance.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly across devices and screen sizes.

---

## Application Architecture

The app follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture using **Appwrite** as the backend for data handling. This structure supports separation of UI, data, and business logic, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

- **Models**: Define data structures for events and users.
- **Views**: Adapt UI components to various screen sizes, ensuring responsive design.
- **Controllers**: Manage authentication, data updates, and event management.

## Responsive User Interfaces

Designed with responsive layouts, the app adapts to various screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience on phones and tablets. Widgets dynamically adjust based on screen dimensions, tested across multiple devices.

### Screenshots

1. **Home Screen**: Lists upcoming events for easy navigation.
2. **Event Details Screen**: Displays full event details and RSVP options.
3. **Organizer Dashboard**: Shows event management tools, optimized for larger screens.

## Data Storage

The application uses **Appwrite** for cloud storage due to its flexibility, scalability, and secure data handling. Appwrite enables secure storage and management of both user and event data, making it ideal for a university event management application.

### Backend Choice: Appwrite

**Appwrite** was selected because it offers:
- **High Customization**: Appwrite’s open-source structure provides a level of customization suitable for applications with specific data handling requirements, like campus events.
- **Data Privacy and Control**: With secure APIs and a flexible database, Appwrite ensures data integrity and compliance with privacy standards.
- **Scalability**: Appwrite supports an expanding user base, efficiently handling high user demand and data storage as the application grows.
- **Extensive RESTful APIs**: Appwrite’s API-driven model simplifies data management and integration, making development faster and more organized.

## State Management

State is managed directly within Flutter, using simple and efficient techniques to ensure a clear separation of data from UI elements. This approach allows for straightforward data handling and easy debugging, helping maintain optimal performance as the app scales.

## APIs/Packages/Plugins Used

### Appwrite
   - **Purpose**: Handles backend functions such as user authentication, file storage, and database interactions.
   - **Justification**: Offers a secure, customizable backend solution with extensive RESTful APIs.

### File Picker
